# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
  This repository contains Python code for classifying iris flowers using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset. 
  
Dataset:
The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. For each flower, there are four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is provided in the file Iris.csv.

Requirements:
  Python 3.x
  Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, scikit-learn
  Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git

Install the required libraries:
  Copy code
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
  Run the iris_classification.py file to train the SVM model and evaluate its accuracy.
  The trained model will be tested using the test set split from the dataset.
  The accuracy and classification report will be printed in the console.
  Copy code
  python iris_classification.py

Results:
  The accuracy of the trained SVM model and the classification report will be printed in the console.
